//Your Own Array: Think of your favorite mode of transportation,
//such as a motorcycle or a car, and make a list that stores several examples.
//Use your list to print a series of statements about these items,
//such as “I would like to own a Honda motorcycle.”

let ownArray = ["Jet", "Car"];
//I don't understand this assignment due the wording used. So I'd instead do a simple print.
console.log("I would like to own a " + ownArray[0]);
console.log("I would like to own a " + ownArray[1]);
