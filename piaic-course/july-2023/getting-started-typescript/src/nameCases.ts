//Name Cases: Store a person’s name in a variable,
//and then print that person’s name in lowercase, uppercase, and titlecase.

let newName = "Ahmed";
console.log(newName.toUpperCase());
console.log(newName.toLowerCase());
//titleCase is not a simple beginner exercise. It is an algorithmic one.
//I'll skip for later.
